# Stochastic Model Case Studies

Stochastic models are well-suited to studying systems in emerging fields such as nanotechnology, computational chemistry, and synthetic biology. However, the kinds of stochastic models which arise in these emerging fields tend to have infinite state space which cannot be analyzed by most existing tools. It is therefore prudent that tools be developed to verify infinite state space stochastic models. Likewise, there does not exist a collection of case studies for analyzing the performance of infinite state space stochastic model checking tools. Here, such a collection is developed and presented. The collection includes case studies from nanotechnology, computational chemistry, and synthetic biology which vary in complexity from toy models to practical designs encoded in the PRISM language. The models can be used in [PRISM](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org), [STORM](https://www.stormchecker.org), or [STAMINA](https://github.com/fluentverification/stamina-cplusplus) or any other tool that uses the PRISM language. The case-study repository presented here is intended to be a living document, so community contributions and recommendations are welcome.
