The modified yeast polarization model represents the pheromone induced G-protein cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisia. This model serves as an archetypal biochemical reaction network which is more complicated than the futile cycle [1]. The modified yeast polarization model includes seven chemical species reacting via eight reaction channels.
