## Genetic Circuits

Genetic design is part of synthetic biology, a research field combining engineering principles with biology. Researchers build circuits out of defined biological parts adding desired functionalities to biological systems. Automation in the design process allows scientists to model and analyze their genetic circuits *in silico* to test the system before implementation. Stochastic model verification has been used to analyze genetic designs before [1], which have an infinite state space and therefore suit the case studies presented here. 
## Naming Convention

* 10_10: Production and degradation of molecules in steps of 10

* RBA: Reaction-based abstraction (remove irrelevant or rapid reactions)

* G0: Static zero glitch

* G1: Static one glitch

* bound: bounded prsim models
